## Usage

IronGym simplifies the management of clients and employees. Hereâ€™s how to use it effectively:

1. **Register/Login**: Start by creating a new account or logging in to an existing one. You may also use the default user account if you prefer not to create a personal account.

2. **Email Verification**: IronGym verifies user email addresses via code to validate accounts, ensuring that only legitimate users can access the app.

3. **User Area**: Once logged in, users can view and edit their personal infomation. Employees also have the ability to modify user data.

4. **Employee Area**: Employees can log in to their exclusive area, where they can view, edit, and delete client information. Use the default employee login to access this area.

5. **Manager Area**: Managers have access to all employee functionalities, plus additional permissions to manage CRUD operations on employee data. Use the default manager login to access this area.
